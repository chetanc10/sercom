# This is a sample scom file to demonstrate usage of scom files for sercom automation

# A good thing to have for any test is to log the version info of SW and HW as much as possible

# Next good thing to do is to enable verbose error reporting

# Get various environment details now from the modem

# - USB Configuration
# - Port Configuration

# Now we start a sequence of commands to achieve/use a specific functionality

# A definitive loop now iterating for 10 times

# Uncomment the following to enable ManualCmd mode for manually enter commands

# Trying an non-existent scom file to see how script reacts
SCOM_enscom 1.scom
SCOM_enscom child.scom

# Break the Scom session and any command after SCOM_break will not be executed!
SCOM_break

########## ALL THE FOLLOWING ARE NOT EXECUTED SINCE WE GAVE 'SCOM_break' above

# This is just an example to help understand scom for an automated and large number of tests divided/grouped as per feature/test-case

# We have multiple methods to run multiple scoms in one run as described below.
#
# 1. FIFO Model - Simply have a mother scom file calling to multiple children scom files with SCOM_enscom command in required order. In a simple FIFO-model child scom file(s) will not contain SCOM_enscom command.
# e.g. FIFO Model below
# example.scom is mother scom with following lines
SCOM_enscom openap.scom
SCOM_enscom wpa2ap.scom
SCOM_enscom wpa3ap.scom
# For above, script sees 'SCOM_enscom openap.scom' and switches to openap.scom and once openap.scom completes, it comes back to open mother scom (example.scom in this case), and positions read-line to next to 'SCOM_enscom openap.scom', i.e. it will now read line 'SCOM_enscom wpa2ap.scom' and so on till scom FIFO is complete

# 2. Daisy Chain - a mother scom will call to child1 scom file. child1 scom calls to child2 scom at it's EOF and so on. 
# e.g. Daisy Chain below
# example.scom is mother scom with EOF content below
SCOM_enscom openap.scom
# openap.scom EOF content below
SCOM_enscom wpa2ap.scom
# wpa2ap.scom EOF content below
SCOM_enscom wpa3ap.scom
# For above, script sees 'SCOM_enscom openap.scom' and switches to openap.scom and inside openap.scom it will encounter 'SCOM_enscom wpa2ap.scom' and switches to wpa2ap.scom and so on.

# 3. Hybrid Chain -  a Hybrid model created by mixing FIFO model with Daisy-chain models, if carefully used, it would work as expected.
